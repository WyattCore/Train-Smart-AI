This is a side project I wanted to develop to show my familiarity with deploying a website using react, javascript, html, node.js, Express, and css. In this project, I worked with accessing ChatGPT's API to tailor a unique and personal experience for the user.

A simple demographic form is presented at the start, then the user is asked for their personal fitness goal. This information is then saved and fed to the ai, along with a prompt that tells the ai to come up with questions for the user based off of their information. These questions are presented to the user and when answered, the user is given a formatted personal plan.

This plan gives the user their goal, example workouts and a brief schedule, a nutrition guide, and some tips/motivation. The user then has the ability to save the workout, which saves their plan to a json file, where it can be accessed again in the plans tab.

Thank you for viewing!
